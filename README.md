I used a builder type for the Farm and the farmer types because i knew i weould need a lot of diifrent ones that needed to be unique. 
These handled everything that was on the farm and all the functions of the farmers.

I used a mediator for the day night handling
That enabled me to easily do the scheduling and day/ night

I used a decorator for the animal classes because they would have so many attributes with so diffrent behaivor.
